               A key project I worked on my internship with ScopeMedia. Under mentorship
               from ScopeMedia&apos;s staff, I had the pleasure of working with a talented
               intern team of designers and developers to create this landing page for
               ScopeX Labs.

               Coming back from winter break, I worked with a team of 4 to create an
               application in one week for the Web Development 4 class at BCIT&apos;s D3
               Program.

               The premise of this application is to theorycraft solutions to the
