# Portfolio 2022 - On Hold

**Purpose**

My inaugural post-graduation portfolio. In this project, I set out to create a portfolio that breaks away from the norm while still prioritizing a seamless user experience. Inspired by standout designs on platforms like Awwwards, I sought a blend of innovative design while not taking away from usability.

During the research phase, I drew inspiration from the desktop UIs of Ubuntu and Mac OS, integrating familiar elements to ensure a comfortable user interface. I aimed to showcase innovative design and practicality, reflecting my passion for both aesthetics and user-centric development.

**Built using**

- Next.js
- Figma (UI Design)
- Adobe Illustrator (Asset Creation)

**Possible Improvements**
- Currently not mobile responsive
    - The idea was to integrate a mobile design resembling an iPhone home screen
- Review current icons to minimize cognitive effort
    - Gear icon resembling tools is usually associated with 'settings' features
